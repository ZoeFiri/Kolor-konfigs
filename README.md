This is a shitty little script I made to generate configs with colors defined at the top of the script. The color theme included by default is the base 16 colorscheme "woodland" but replace it with whatever colors you like. To use it,

- Put the placeholders zc0-zcF (last digit is hexedecimal, in the spirit of base16 theming)
- put configs you wish to use in the directory "templates"
- run script, new configs will be placed in the dir "new"

I recommend just symlinking each of the configs to their appropriate locations, so that you can easily change the colorscheme.
